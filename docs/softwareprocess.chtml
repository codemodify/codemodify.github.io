<title>The Ways of Software Process</title>


<body><pre>

    The software process is defined by the complex way to take to produce a software product.
    The complexity and success of the process is tied to one key moment:
    - communication between people and sites.


    Approaches

        Offshore Development
            o - Use Continuous Integration to Avoid Integration Headaches
            o - Have Each Site Send Ambassadors to the Other Sites
            o - Use Contact Visits to build trust
            o - Don't Underestimate the Culture Change
            o - Use wikis to contain common information
            o - Use Test Scripts to Help Understand the Requirements
            o - Use Regular Builds to Get Feedback on Functionality
            o - Use Regular Short Status Meetings
            o - Use Short Iterations
            o - Use an Iteration Planning Meeting that's Tailored for Remote Sites
            o - When Moving a Code Base, Bug Fixing Makes a Good Start
            o - Separate teams by functionality not activity
            o - Expect to need more documents.
            o - Get multiple communication modes working early
            
            The weak spots of offshore development come from culture and distance with the business.
            Because agile development works best with close communication and an open culture, agilists 
            working offshore feel the pain much more than those using plan-driven approaches. But it's still 
            less pain than the plan-driven methods themselves!
